# photon-native-css

A userChrome.css to apply on top of Photon (Firefox 57+) that uses more native OS elements.

Put userChrome.css in a folder called "chrome" in your profile directory. If you're using macOS, there's a rule commented out in the file that you'll probably want to enable.

Tested on:

* Windows 10 (looks good)
* macOS High Sierra (looks ok)
