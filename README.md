# photon-native-css

A userChrome.css to apply on top of Photon (Firefox 57+) that uses more native OS elements.

Put userChrome.css in a folder called "chrome" in your profile directory. Then restart Firefox and enable the light theme.

Tested on:

* Windows 10
* Windows 7, default theme
* Windows 7, classic theme (the toolbar buttons are just CSS)
* macOS High Sierra
  * Recommended to set density to Compact
  * There's a set of rules in the .css file you should enable to space the toolbar buttons out more
* Unix+GTK3
  * There's a set of rules in the .css file you should enable to make the toolbar buttons smaller
